      <h6>About Me</h6>
      <div class="fakeimg" style="height:100px;">Image</div>
      <p>I started Martial Arts at the young age of 6 or 7. My dad thought 
      it was time that he passed his knowledge down to me. I have practiced traditional
      and untraditional martial arts. Poetry is another hobby that I love deeply. It allows 
      me to express myself more deeply.</p>

      <p>Till next time, keeping pushing forward!</p>
